# Blog.Modern Developer UI

### Team Fabulous-Jackal ([Pdeleon](https://github.com/pdeleon) & [Aashish Nagpal](https://github.com/aashishnagpal))

**[UI Live Demo](https://pdeleon.github.io/blog-moderndeveloper-ui-project/)**


**Workflow** 
The UI mockup given to us as a part of Team Project Assignment was pretty straight-forward to break down into individual components. PJ broke it down to 
- Header
- Article Section
- Other Articles navigation links on the side
- Comments Section
- Footer

Once this was decided, he added almost all the HTML content in index.html and pretty much created the whole folder structure for the project which he then pushed to GitHub and added Aashish as a collaborator for the repository.

The communication for the project was done on a PM on QA initially and then Modern Developer Team Slack afterwards.

Aashish took up the task to start on the CSS for first 3 sections and PJ took the last 2. Aashish worked on a separate branch to keep any code from inturrupting PJ's work and eventually merged his branch to the master and gh-pages branch once the code reached critical mass.

**Pdeleon did following:**

- Added HTML content for entire page
- Added CSS for Footer section
- Added CSS for Comments section

**Aashish Nagpal did following:**

- Updated HTML content for the first 3 sections (mentioned above) to properly align corresponding CSS with them
- Added CSS for Header (Title and Search bar)
- Added CSS for Main Article
- Added CSS for Recent/Upcoming Articles Aside (Tab functionality to be added later)
- Added PrismJS(http://prismjs.com/) for code highlighting within the article.
